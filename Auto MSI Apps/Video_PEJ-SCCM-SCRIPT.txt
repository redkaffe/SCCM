This script is a work in progress!!!

It is used to integrate quickly a bunch of applications into SCCM, and build a few Deployment Types (DTs) for each application if needed.

It is meant to use MSI files ONLY...I'm lazy so I wanted to be able to build a demo lab quickly with latest versions of client's apps...

I'll try to add more intelligence to it when i have the time, typically i want to add REQUIREMENTS to the DTs to force non 'Common' DTs to be picked by the apropriate OSes.

Disclaimer: Use it at your own risk, tests have been done but to the extend of my lab, so you know...If you brake anything, don't blame me!!!
















Step 1: download your sources MSIs and arrange them in the proper (expected) manner:
DIR1 : Sources_Apps
------DIR2 : App1Name (used if no x86/x64 specs, will be used for a DT called 'Common')
--------------DIR3: x86 (contains x86 msi, will be used for x86 DT)
--------------DIR3: x64 (contains x64 msi, will be used for x64 DT)
------DIR2 : App2Name (used if no x86/x64 specs, will be used for a DT called 'Common')
--------------DIR3: x86 (contains x86 msi, will be used for x86 DT)
--------------DIR3: x64 (contains x64 msi, will be used for x64 DT)
And so ON...



















Step 2: References needed for the script modifications



in my example: 
HOSTNAME = CM01 (Site server for "RK1" SCCM SITE)
Physical drive containing DIR1: S:\SRC\APPs\Sources_Apps (locally on CM SITE Server)
Network Accessible Share for DIR1: \\CM01\SRC\APPS\Sources_Apps (used for package content)

















Step 3: Edit the script to include: 
-SITENAME (here "RK1")
-Sources for Apps repository (here: "S:\SRC\APPs\Sources_Apps")
-UNC Share for Apps Sources (here "\\CM01\SRC\APPS\Sources_Apps")














Step 4: Launch the script from elevated PS Prompt
...and watch it go thru the dirs and create APPs and their DTs.










Please send me any feedback!

the script goes thru the directories, get the MSI info from the source and populates the "Application" accordingly (thanks to David O'Brien et Nickolaj Andersen!!!)

AND FEEL FREE TO GIVE ME FEEDBACK, if anything at all needs improvement, please send me your ideas, problems...and any improvements:)

OK, done!
20 Apps in under 5 minutes...Cool no?

thanks for your time:)
